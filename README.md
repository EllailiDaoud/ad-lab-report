Active Directory environment and hardened it against common attack techniques.

| Component | Purpose |

| **Windows Server 2019** | Domain Controller (AD DS, DNS) |
| **Windows 10** | Domain-joined workstation |
| **Splunk (Ubuntu)** | Centralised log collection & SIEM |
| **Kali Linux** | Attacker box for BloodHound, Mimikatz, CME |

We cover installation, Group Policy hardening (LAPS, audit settings), attack
simulation, and log-based detection with Splunk.
